# Correlation-Identification

This repository represents the code for correlation identification in event logs based on the code available at [plot_classifier_comparison](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html)

* Note: if you are looking for the code for ML models creation and storage, you need to switch to the *develop* branch.
